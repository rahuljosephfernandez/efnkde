## EFNKDE (Edge-Focused Network Kernel Density Estimation)

Caribou_Data.csv contains 100 point caribou data taken from Ref [1], i.e., (2014). Science update for the South Peace Northern Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou pop. 15) in British Columbia. Victoria, BC. 43 p. The same has been used in figures 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Fish_Data.csv contains 25 point fish data captured as Video S1 (also see Video_S1_Metadata.pdf). The same has been used in figures 7 and 8.

The following are the codes  to generate the kernel density as predicted by EFNKDE. More details are in the beginning of the respective files.
